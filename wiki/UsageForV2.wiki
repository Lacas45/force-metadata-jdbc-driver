#summary How to use version 2.x of the driver with SchemaSpy (not finished yet)

= Introduction =

NOT FINISHED YET...

Here is how to generate the http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/ SchemaSpy] output for your Force.com org:

 * Download the [http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/ SchemaSpy] jar
 * Download the [http://code.google.com/p/force-metadata-jdbc-driver/downloads/list JDBC driver] jar
 * In the folder that contains these jars just enter this (replacing the arguments that start with "My" with your own values and entering it all on one line):
{{{
java -cp schemaSpy_5.0.0.jar:force-metadata-jdbc-driver-2.0.jar net.sourceforge.schemaspy.Main
        -t force -u fake -p fake -host fake -un MyUserName -pw MyPasswordAndSecurityToken
        -font Arial -fontsize 8 -hq -norows -db MyDbName -desc "Extracted from MyDbName on Force.com" -o doc
}}}

Note that the code is built to wok with Java 1.5 so will also work with Java 1.6.

I have tested this new version of the driver with:

 * SchemaSpy 5.0.0
 * Graphviz 2.26.3
