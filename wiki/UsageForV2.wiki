#summary How to use version 2.x of the driver with SchemaSpy (not finished yet)

= Introduction =

NOT FINISHED YET...

Here is how to generate the [http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/ SchemaSpy] output for your Force.com org:

 * Download the [http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/ SchemaSpy] jar
 * Download and install [http://www.graphviz.org/ Graphviz] that is used by SchemaSpy to create the automatically laid out diagrams
 * Download the [http://code.google.com/p/force-metadata-jdbc-driver/downloads/list Force Metadata JDBC driver] jar
 * In the folder that contains the jars just enter this (replacing the arguments that start with "My" with your own values and entering it all on one line):

{{{
java -cp schemaSpy_5.0.0.jar;force-metadata-jdbc-driver-2.0.jar net.sourceforge.schemaspy.Main
    -t force -u fake -p fake -host fake -un MyUserName -pw MyPasswordAndSecurityToken
    -font Arial -fontsize 8 -hq -norows -db MyDbName -desc "Extracted from MyDbName on Force.com" -o doc
}}}

Except for the -un and -pw arguments these are all standard SchemaSpy arguments that are explained in the [http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/ SchemaSpy] web site. The file force.properties is now included in the driver jar and accessed from there. he only change needed for Mac/Unix is the -cp argument separator changing from ";" to ":".

By default all custom objects are output. The set of objects that are output can be customized via the -connprops argument. Here is an example that outputs three standard objects in addition to all the custom outputs:
{{{
    -connprops excludes\=;includes\=User,Task,Event
}}}
On Mac/Unix bash this would need to be:
{{{
    -connprops excludes\\=\;includes\\=User,Task,Event
}}}
More details of how this property can be used are in the [http://code.google.com/p/force-metadata-jdbc-driver/wiki/Useage orignal usage page].

Note that the code is built to work with Java 1.5 so will also work with Java 1.6. This new version of the driver has been test with:

 * SchemaSpy 5.0.0
 * Graphviz 2.26.3
